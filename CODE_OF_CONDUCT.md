# Code of Conduct

> The Pub Rules: Don't be the person who gets us all kicked out.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Also regardless of beer preference. We don't judge (much).

## Our Standards

**Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:**

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Buying a round occasionally (metaphorically speaking)

**Examples of unacceptable behavior:**

- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
- Starting arguments about which beer is best (there is no wrong answer except "none")

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Think of maintainers as the bartenders. We reserve the right to cut you off.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html

**TL;DR:** Be excellent to each other. This is a fun project - let's keep it that way.
